This is a Qt5 GUI that uses the Rust sudoku library for all of its game logic. It serves as a testbed for the further development of the APIs around the sudoku solver that's using human strategies. The goal is to have a library that offers all the functionality to solve, generate and grade sudokus as well as give hints or full solution paths.
